            <h1 class="title is-2">FAQs</h1>




            <p class="is-size-4">Q: What do you mean when you say the ride is "drizzle or shine"?</p>
            <p class="is-size-4 mb-4">A: The ride will happen if the weather doesn't look too bad. A forecast of some
                drizzle or a 30% chance of a passing shower
                will not cancel the ride. However, if it looks really bad and the forecast for Sunday, May 9 looks good
                we will move to that date. If you sign up for the ride on the "contact" page we will email you with news
                such as a change of date.</p>
            <p class="is-size-4">Q: How do I get to the start and home from the finish?</p>
            <p class="is-size-4 mb-4">A: Riders supply their own transport to the start and home from the finish.
                Usually this means finding somebody to be your support driver. If you sign up for the ride on the
                "contact" page we can send you information about other riders who might be able to share a ride to the
                start or
                home from the finish. </p>
            <p class="is-size-4">Q: Do I need to sign up in advance, or can I just show up at the start and ride?</p>
            <p class="is-size-4 mb-4">A: You do not need to sign up, but if you do it will help us plan the event.</p>
            <p class="is-size-4">Q: What kind of event is this?</p>
            <p class="is-size-4 mb-4">A: A fun, informal event. It's a bunch of cyclists meeting in Milton, NC in the
                morning
                and riding to Gibson, NC in one day. Some of them may treat it like a race, although there are no
                official
                times, results, or prizes. Some may treat it like a group ride with the local club, although there is no
                club
                affiliation (except that you can brag that you are in the select club of those who have crossed North
                Carolina
                in one day). Some may treat it like a randonnee, or like a long training ride, or something else. It's
                whatever you want it to be.</p>
            </p>
            <p class="is-size-4">Q: Am I allowed to wear socks?</p>
            <p class="is-size-4 mb-4">A: Yes. However, if you don't wear socks there is no entry fee. </p>
            </p>
            <p class="is-size-4">Q: What is the entry fee if I DO wear socks?</p>
            <p class="is-size-4 mb-4">A: If you wear socks there is no entry fee. </p>
            <p class="is-size-4">Q: Can I ride just a portion of the NoSoX NC, or bail out half way and ride home to
                Chapel Hill?</p>
            <p class="is-size-4 mb-4">A: Sure. Just let us know what you're doing so we don't worry that you've had an
                accident or been eaten by a bear.
